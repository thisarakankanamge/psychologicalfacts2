				<ul class="listing">
					<li>They appears to be <q>too much caring</q>. If you are getting too much of attention from a stranger then take a pause often and evaluate.</li>
					<li>A standard technique they apply is : whenever you ask them anything which you find suspicious they will start blaming you. Blame Game is a great tool they use to divert questioning.</li>
					<li>To gain brownie points they will slowly instigate you against your closed ones . You start suspecting your closed ones</li>
					<li>Most of the manipulators are good communicators. Not the vice versa always though. They know how to extract your thoughts without revealing anything about others .</li>
					<li>Most of the manipulators tell emotional stories which are often lie or fictional. You start empathizing and then you fall into trap. When someone tells you such stories from beginning then take a pause.</li>
					<li>They will again and again say you <q>how close they are to you</q> even though you just met them few days ago or have interacted few times before.</li>

				<h2>Build up Skills</h2>
				<h5>The best way to improve <span>Communication skills and Confidence.</span></h5>
				<ul class="listing">
					<li>Go Out There And Practice. It is not going to get any better by you just hiding in the corner. Go approach someone. The first time is always the worst. It gets better after that!</li>
					<li>Realize That Rejection Only Hurts Your Ego. You do not suddenly become less valuable because you were rejected. You as a person are still you. The only thing rejection hurts is something in your head; which is not all you are.</li>
					<li>Chose To Be Confident. You can simply decide to be confident today. You need no reason to feel confident inside; You can simply decide on it. Think about what a confident person would do in your situation and do it!</li>
					<li>Face Your Fears. The only reason you are not saying what you want, not being utterly yourself and the only reason you are holding back is because you are afraid something could turn bad. You could lose your status, your friends or be embarrassed. Become okay with that and you will be instantly more confident.</li>
					<li>Have An Open Posture. Hands on your sides, back straight, chest out and head held level. <q>Motion creates Emotion.</q> - Tony Robbins. Various Psychological studies have been done on confident body language, specifically in CEOs. Take up space and stand, sit and walk proudly.</li>
